/**
 * Reference roots: explicit rows that keep asset entries alive.
 *
 * A document keeps the entries it names alive through `document_asset_refs`,
 * which the document store derives from the document itself
 * (`./references.ts`). Some owners of an asset are not documents -- a library
 * entry that holds an uploaded original, say -- and name their assets
 * directly. Such an owner records `(root_kind, root_id, asset_id)` rows in
 * `asset_root_refs` through {@link changeAssetRoots}, and the entry lifecycle
 * treats a root exactly like a document reference (`./liveness.ts`): while a
 * row names an entry, nothing stamps it and the collector never releases it.
 *
 * `root_kind` and `root_id` are opaque to this package. It never interprets
 * either, and it never decides which roots exist -- the caller owns that, in
 * its own records, in the same transaction as the call.
 *
 * ## What a call does
 *
 * One call changes any number of roots, and it runs entirely in the caller's
 * transaction (`queryable` must be a transaction the caller owns and
 * commits), so a caller's own records and the roots they imply commit or roll
 * back together:
 *
 * 1. Every entry the call touches -- the union of the ids it adds and removes
 *    -- is locked in ONE ascending statement, before any write, following the
 *    package's lock rule (see `lockEntriesInOrder` in `./references.ts`).
 * 2. Ownership is checked under that lock: each id being added must exist and
 *    be held by one of `principals`, and each id being removed whose entry
 *    still exists must be held by one of `principals`. Anything else refuses
 *    the whole call with {@link AssetRootTargetError} before a row is written.
 *    This is deliberately stricter than document references, which skip ids
 *    they cannot resolve: a root is an explicit claim, not something inferred
 *    from content.
 * 3. The removed rows are deleted -- exactly the named `(kind, id, asset)`
 *    rows, reported back by `RETURNING` -- and the added rows are inserted.
 * 4. Every entry that gained a root is committed, exactly as a document write
 *    commits what it names: `committed_at` is set once, and `expires_at` and
 *    `unreferenced_at` are cleared.
 * 5. Only the entries whose root row was ACTUALLY deleted are considered for a
 *    stamp, in a statement of their own that sees both reference tables in a
 *    fresh snapshot. An entry still named by any document or any root is left
 *    alone, and an id whose root row did not exist changes nothing at all.
 *
 * Nothing here deletes an entry or a byte. Releasing is the collector's job,
 * after its own grace period and its own locked re-check.
 *
 * ## What a caller must not combine it with
 *
 * The one-statement lock above is only a guarantee if it is the only
 * `asset_entries` lock the transaction takes. Call this at most once per
 * transaction, and not in a transaction that also maintains document
 * references (a document save or delete), calls `PgAssetStore.replace`,
 * `remove` or `reassignPrincipal`, or runs the collector's backfill: each of
 * those locks entries in a statement of its own, and two ascending sequences
 * in one transaction can still deadlock another writer. Allocating a new
 * entry with `PgAssetStore.put` earlier in the same transaction is fine; no
 * other transaction can see or lock that row before the commit.
 *
 * ## How a caller keeps roots attributable
 *
 * `principals` bounds which entries a call may root or unroot; it cannot say
 * which roots belong to whom, because this package does not interpret
 * `root_id`. A caller that attaches roots to its own records keeps that
 * relation itself: it locks the record the root belongs to, confirms the
 * record is the caller's, passes only that record's id as `rootId`, and
 * removes only the asset ids its root rows actually hold. Removing a whole
 * record means reading those rows under the record's lock and passing them
 * here.
 *
 * A host that fences its owners' writes (an identity lock a merge of two
 * owners takes exclusively) takes that fence first in the same transaction,
 * then the record's row lock, then calls this -- the one order in which a
 * root write, a merge and the collector cannot wait on each other in a cycle
 * -- and passes only the owner's own partition as `principals`, never a
 * partition every owner shares.
