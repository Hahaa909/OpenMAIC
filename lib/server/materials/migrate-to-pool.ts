/**
 * Move owner materials uploaded before the asset pool into it.
 *
 * A ready source from before the pool records its original as an object in the
 * material byte store (`oss_key`) and has no pool pointer. One bounded pass
 * walks those rows in id order and, for each:
 *
 * 1. reads the object and checks it against the digest recorded at upload;
 * 2. allocates a pending pool entry for it under the owner's own partition;
 * 3. publishes the pointer and the `('material', id)` root in one transaction
 *    (`withMaterialRoots`), only if the row is still a ready source with no
 *    pointer -- a second migrator of the same row gives up, and so does a pass
 *    whose row was deleted meanwhile. A pass that gives up this way removes its
 *    own allocation, which nothing names, so it does not hold quota until it
 *    expires; a publication whose outcome is uncertain keeps it;
 * 4. re-reads the row, and only when the pointer is there, committed, deletes
 *    the object and clears `oss_key`.
 *
 * Step 4 decides on the database's committed state, never on whether a
 * publication call returned: a publication whose outcome is uncertain deletes
 * nothing this pass, and the next pass sees what actually committed. A row
 * whose pointer committed but whose object outlived a failed delete (or a
 * crash) still has its `oss_key`, so the next pass picks it up again and goes
 * straight to step 4; the delete is idempotent.
 *
 * A deleted source is never migrated, and this pass does not look at it.
 * Its old object is removed right after the deletion commits; when that
 * fails, {@link removeDeletedOriginals} retries it on every start, flag or
 * not. That needs no flag because no reader is left for the object of a
 * deleted row, and step 4 is the same: the committed tombstone, like a
 * committed pointer, is what allows the delete.
 *
 * The pass never reads a row twice: the cursor only moves forward, and a row
 * that fails is counted and left for the next pass. Several instances may run
 * it at once: the row lock and the empty-pointer check settle each row.
 *
 * It runs only when an operator turns it on (`MATERIALS_POOL_BACKFILL=1`, see
 * `instrumentation.ts`), after every instance runs this release: deleting an
 * original while an older instance can still start would put it beyond that
 * instance's reach, and an older bootstrap drops the pointers. Not running it
 * is harmless: readers fall back to `oss_key`.
 *
 * Existing session copies are never touched; they are the sessions' own.
